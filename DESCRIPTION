Description: 
    A modeling competition ("Hackathon") is a contest in which teams attempt to 
    maximize their performance on data with hidden labels by developing a
    machine learning prediction algorithm with public training data.
    This package polls github to download submissions, scores them and uploads a
    readerboard.

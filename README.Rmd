This contains the holdout data and other resources that must not be shared publicly.

This also contains the code that scores submissions for the hackathon.

# Contents

* Leaderboard.Rmd: rmarkdown after compiling results, copy to public repo when done
* private/: hold out data labels and team manifest.
* R/: code

# Use

```r
source('drake/drake-plan.R')
make(plan)
```

This sets up a drake workflow to poll all repos in 
`private/MANIFEST.csv`, score them, write Leaderboard.html,
and copy to the parent repo.

# Todo

  * Track project-specific using a yaml or otherwise configuration file rather than global variables in drake-plan.R.
  * Add a function to initialize a Hackathon private directory, copying down the drake workflow.

# Colophone

```{r}
library(Hackathon)
sessionInfo()
```

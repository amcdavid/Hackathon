# "Hackathon" predictive modeling competitions on github


By a "Hackathon" I mean a lightweight kaggle-style predictive modeling competition, e.g. for class projects.

This contains code to 

* create project structures to run such a competition
* collect submission from github
* score submissions
* and maintain a leaderboard (that uses github pages).

Variants of this code have been used several times by the author run such competitions.  See the very WIP vignette.
